      "At some point of time we started to decouple our form objects from models. Things got a lot easier when we found out there is a ready to use solution which solves our exact problem. That was Reform. Soon after, we started using all other parts of Trailblazer and haven't regretted a second of our time we spent using it."

      "Trailblazer helps organize my code, the book showed me how. You can assume what each component does by its name, it's very easy and intuitive, it should be shipped as an essential part of Rails."

      Trailblazer has brought the fun back to Rails for me. It helps me organize large codebases into small, smart, testable chunks. Nick has brought together his years of insight in managing Rails projects and made them available for everyone. Any Rails engineer looking to expand past the default Rails Way should take a look at Trailblazer.

      I haven't been this excited about Rails since 2007! Trailblazer - makes Rails development fun again. Especially on large projects. It's one of the better implementations of the ServiceObject / ViewModel / Form Object / Policy layers I've seen, which sooner or later ( rather sooner) you'll need.
